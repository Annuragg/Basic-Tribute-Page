                From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense
                minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser
                (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a
                national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the
                international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide
                plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road
                map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed
                society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures,
                increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health
                care and education. Associated with engineering is a great body
                of special knowledge; preparation for professional practice
                involves extensive training in the application of that
                knowledge. Standards of engineering practice are maintained
                through the efforts of professional societies, usually organized
                on a national or regional basis, with all members acknowledging
                a responsibility to the public over and above responsibilities
                to their employers or to other members of their society. The
                function of the scientist is to know, while that of the engineer
                is to do. Scientists add to the store of verified systematized
                knowledge of the physical world, and engineers bring this
                knowledge to bear on practical problems. Engineering is based
                principally on physics, chemistry, and mathematics and their
                extensions into materials science, solid and fluid mechanics,
                thermodynamics, transfer and rate processes, and systems
                analysis. Unlike scientists, engineers are not free to select
                the problems that interest them. They must solve problems as
                they arise, and their solutions must satisfy conflicting
                requirements. Usually, efficiency costs money, safety adds to
                complexity, and improved performance increases weight. The
                engineering solution is the optimum solution, the end result
                that, taking many factors into account, is most desirable. It
                may be the most reliable within a given weight limit, the
                simplest that will satisfy certain safety requirements, or the
                most efficient for a given cost. In many engineering problems
                the social and environmental costs are significant. Engineers
                employ two types of natural resources—materials and energy.
                Materials are useful because of their properties: their
                strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or durability; their
                ability to insulate or conduct; their chemical, electrical, or
                acoustical properties. Important sources of energy include
                fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas), wind, sunlight,
                falling water, and nuclear fission. Since most resources are
                limited, engineers must concern themselves with the continual
